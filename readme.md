# qb1

    The speed of binary,
        the security of encryption,
            the ease of text,
                and the tools to manage it all with confidence.


qb1 format is a synergy of encoding, type-definitions, indexing and data layout.  Documents are under
construction to catch up with latest iterations of work and trials... here's what we have:


* [principles upon which qb1 is designed](https://github.com/quicbit-js/qb1/blob/master/ref/first-principles.md)
* [foundations of qb1 binary encoding](https://github.com/quicbit-js/qb1/blob/master/ref/qb1-encoding-foundation.md)
* [qb1 range syntax](https://github.com/quicbit-js/qb1/blob/master/ref/ranges.md)
* [complex type representation](https://github.com/quicbit-js/qb1/blob/master/ref/complex-types.md)
* [comparison with json-schema](https://github.com/quicbit-js/qb1/blob/master/ref/json-schema.md)
